- Before running the project, make sure that the nodejs and mongodb compass is installed on your system
- After that, I have provided the two zip files to you, put them in one directory

Folder

 - server

- After that checkout on server first run "npm run install' and run the command 'npm run start:dev', server will be started
- Now, check-out to the client directory, run first 'npm run install' to install the node modules and then run 'npm run dev'
